# cards-sim
### _Will Osborne <willfosborne@gmail.com>_

This isn't much, for now! It's a framework for games about cards - heavily inspired by Cultist Simulator and Doodle God.

Common Lisp is an absolute dream to make games in; I can't recommend it enough.

Libraries:

 * trivial-gamekit by borodust - graphics, input and so on
 * cl-fad - file system helper library
